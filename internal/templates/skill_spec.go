# /spec — Create a new product spec

## Trigger

User invokes ` + "`/spec`" + ` with a feature title or description.

## Instructions

1. **Determine the next F-NNNN ID** — Read ` + "`docs/BACKLOG.md`" + ` and scan for the highest existing ` + "`F-NNNN`" + ` ID. The next spec gets the next sequential number (e.g., if the highest is F-0041, the next is F-0042)
2. **Create the spec file** — Copy ` + "`docs/specs/TEMPLATE.md`" + ` to ` + "`docs/specs/F-NNNN-short-slug.md`" + ` where:
   - ` + "`NNNN`" + ` is the next sequential ID (zero-padded to 4 digits)
   - ` + "`short-slug`" + ` is a kebab-case version of the feature title (e.g., "Add dark mode" becomes ` + "`add-dark-mode`" + `)
3. **Fill in the spec** — Update the copied template with:
   - **Title:** The feature title from the user's input
   - **Type:** Feature, Bug, or Enhancement (infer from the description, default to Feature)
   - **Priority:** P1 unless the user specifies otherwise
   - **Status:** Draft
   - **Requested by:** PO
   - **Date:** Today's date
   - **Problem:** Describe the problem or need based on the user's input
   - **Requirements:** Numbered list of specific, testable requirements
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Checkboxes with measurable criteria
   - **Out of Scope:** Note what is explicitly excluded
   - **Dependencies:** List any dependencies on other features
4. **Report back** — Show the user the path to the new spec file and a summary of what was created
