# /release — Cut a new release

## Trigger

User invokes ` + "`/release`" + ` with a version number (e.g., ` + "`/release v0.5.0`" + `).

## Instructions

1. **Determine the version** — Use the version number provided by the user. If none is provided, read ` + "`docs/RELEASENOTES.md`" + ` to find the latest version and suggest the next patch/minor/major bump
2. **Update release notes** — Edit ` + "`docs/RELEASENOTES.md`" + ` and add a new version entry at the top (below the header) following Keep a Changelog format:
   - ` + "`## [vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`" + `
   - Sections: ` + "`### Added`" + `, ` + "`### Changed`" + `, ` + "`### Fixed`" + ` (only include sections with content)
   - Summarize changes since the last release by reading recent git commits
3. **Commit the release** — Stage and commit all pending changes:
   ` + "```" + `
   git -c user.name="{{.OwnerName}}" -c user.email="{{.OwnerEmail}}" commit -am "Release vX.Y.Z: summary"
   ` + "```" + `
   Include ` + "`Co-Authored-By: Claude {{.ModelName}} <noreply@anthropic.com>`" + ` in the commit message
4. **Create an annotated git tag:**
   ` + "```" + `
   git -c user.name="{{.OwnerName}}" -c user.email="{{.OwnerEmail}}" tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z: summary"
   ` + "```" + `
5. **Push the commit and tag:**
   ` + "```" + `
   git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ` + "```" + `
6. **Report back** — Confirm the release was created, tagged, and pushed
