# /regenerate — Regenerate project files from settings

## Trigger

User invokes ` + "`/regenerate`" + ` to regenerate CLAUDE.md and all agent/skill files from saved settings.

## Instructions

1. **Verify settings exist** — Check that ` + "`.appteam/settings.json`" + ` exists in the project root. If it does not exist, inform the user that no saved settings were found and suggest running ` + "`appteam`" + ` interactively first
2. **Run regeneration** — Execute:
   ` + "```" + `
   appteam -r
   ` + "```" + `
   This reads ` + "`.appteam/settings.json`" + ` and regenerates all files (CLAUDE.md, agent definitions, skill files, docs templates)
3. **Restore tracking files** — After regeneration, restore project-specific tracking files from git so they are not overwritten:
   ` + "```" + `
   git checkout -- docs/BACKLOG.md docs/PROGRESS.md docs/RELEASENOTES.md
   ` + "```" + `
   If any of these files have uncommitted changes, warn the user before restoring
4. **Report results** — List all files that were regenerated and confirm the tracking files were preserved

## Project Context

- **Project:** {{.ProjectName}}
- **Settings file:** ` + "`.appteam/settings.json`" + `
