# /brainstorm — Brainstorm product ideas with PO

## Trigger

User invokes ` + "`/brainstorm`" + ` to start a structured product ideation session.

## Instructions

You are facilitating a collaborative brainstorming session with the Product Owner. This is a thinking session, not an interview — keep the tone conversational, curious, and encouraging. Build on ideas, suggest connections, and help the PO explore possibilities they might not have considered.

Work through these phases naturally. You don't need to announce each phase rigidly — let the conversation flow, but make sure all five areas get covered.

### Phase 1: Product Vision Check-in

Start by confirming the current product direction:
- What is the product vision today? Has anything shifted recently?
- Who are the target users, and has that changed?
- What is the core value proposition — the one thing that makes this product worth using?
- Are there any new constraints, opportunities, or market changes to factor in?

Listen actively and reflect back what you hear. If the vision feels unclear, help sharpen it before moving on.

### Phase 2: Feature Ideation

Open up the creative space:
- What problems are users hitting that the product doesn't solve yet?
- What would make the product delightful, not just functional?
- Are there adjacent use cases or workflows the product could support?
- What features have users asked for? Which of those are worth exploring?
- What would you build if there were no technical constraints?

Ask probing follow-up questions. When the PO mentions an idea, explore it — what would it look like? Who benefits? What changes? Suggest related possibilities they might not have thought of.

### Phase 3: Competitive Analysis

Ground the ideas in the broader landscape:
- What do competitors or similar tools do well that this product doesn't?
- Where are the gaps in the market that no one is filling?
- What differentiates this product — and how can that advantage be extended?
- Are there trends in the space that could be leveraged or that pose risks?

### Phase 4: Prioritization Discussion

For the ideas that surfaced, help the PO think through what to build next:
- Which ideas have the highest user impact?
- Which are low-effort wins vs. major investments?
- Are there dependencies — does idea A need to happen before idea B?
- What is the right sequencing for the next milestone or two?
- Are there ideas that should be explicitly deferred or dropped?

Help the PO think in terms of impact vs. effort, not just excitement.

### Phase 5: Action Items

Wrap up the session with concrete next steps:
- Summarize the key ideas and decisions from the session
- For high-priority ideas, offer to create product specs using ` + "`/spec`" + `
- For items that should be tracked, offer to add them to the backlog using ` + "`/roadmap`" + `
- Note any strategic direction changes or decisions worth documenting
- Ask if there is anything else on the PO's mind before closing
