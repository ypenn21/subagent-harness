# /test — Write tests for a module or function

## Trigger

User invokes ` + "`/test`" + ` with a target file, function, or module to test.

## Instructions

1. **Read the target code** — Understand the function signatures, input types, return values, and side effects. Note any dependencies or external calls
2. **Identify edge cases** — Consider:
   - Normal/happy path inputs
   - Boundary values (zero, empty, nil, max)
   - Error conditions (invalid input, missing data, permission errors)
   - Concurrency concerns (if applicable)
3. **Generate table-driven tests** — Use the table-driven test pattern:
   - Define a slice of test cases with name, inputs, and expected outputs
   - Use ` + "`t.Run(tc.name, ...)`" + ` for subtests
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
4. **Follow testing best practices:**
   - Use ` + "`t.TempDir()`" + ` for any filesystem operations
   - No external dependencies — use only the standard library
   - Write meaningful assertion messages that explain what was expected vs what was received
   - Use ` + "`t.Helper()`" + ` in helper functions
   - Use ` + "`t.Parallel()`" + ` where safe
5. **Run the tests** — Execute the test suite and verify all tests pass:
   ` + "```" + `
   go test ./... -v
   ` + "```" + `
6. **Report coverage** — Check coverage for the target package:
   ` + "```" + `
   go test ./path/to/package -cover
   ` + "```" + `
7. **Report back** — Summarize: how many tests were added, what cases are covered, and the coverage percentage
